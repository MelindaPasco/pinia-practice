# pinia-practice

Project done with Vue 3 in Vite.  
A little practice with the Pinia store in the form of a Task list (yes, again, one of those haha).  
  
Features :  
- Add new tasks  
- Delete existing ones  
- Mark task as Favorite  
- Filter to display Favorites only  
  
The data are not being persisted, as it was not really the goal of this porject.
